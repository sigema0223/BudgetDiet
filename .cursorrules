# Cursor AI Behavior Guidelines

## Project Context
This project is a document analysis and budget management application following Clean Architecture principles.

## Coding Rules

### TypeScript
- `strict: true` mode required
- Type safety first
- Explicit type declarations recommended

### Architecture Principles
- **Domain Layer**: Contains only pure business logic, no external dependencies allowed
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External library and API implementations
- **Application Layer**: Use case orchestration
- Dependency direction: Infrastructure → Application → Domain

### Code Style
- Dependency inversion through interfaces
- Error handling through Result<T, E> pattern
- Clear function and variable naming
- Comments explain "why", code explains "what"

### File Structure
- Each layer is clearly separated
- Related files are grouped in the same directory
- Use kebab-case for file names

### Testing
- Testable structure through Mock clients
- Domain logic written as pure functions for easy testing

## Important Notes
- No external library imports in Domain Layer
- Business logic only resides in Domain Layer
- Infrastructure implements Domain interfaces
